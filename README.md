# BasicAuthLearningEx

This repository demonstrates how to implement Basic Authentication in Python. It includes examples of making HTTP requests with Basic Auth headers and handling responses.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

You can install the `requests` library using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Usage

### Basic Authentication Example

The `BasicAuthEx.py` script provides an example of making a GET request to a protected resource using Basic Authentication:

```python
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

url = 'https://example.com/protected-resource'
response = requests.get(url, auth=HTTPBasicAuth('your_username', 'your_password'))

print(response.status_code)
print(response.text)
```

Replace `'your_username'` and `'your_password'` with your actual credentials, and `'https://example.com/protected-resource'` with the URL of the resource you wish to access.

## Configuration

Ensure that your credentials are stored securely. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in your scripts. Consider using environment variables or configuration files to manage your credentials securely.

## License
